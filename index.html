        <h2>Our Experience</h2>
        <div class="experience">
            <h3>Refusal to Pay ER Visit Bills</h3>
            <p>IMG refused to pay for an emergency room visit, citing a pre-existing condition. This was despite their policy stating coverage for pre-existing acute onset conditions.</p>
            
            <h3>Delays in Processing Claims</h3>
            <p>We experienced significant delays in claim processing, often exceeding promised response times by months.</p>
            
            <h3>Concealment of Claims Information</h3>
            <p>All our claims were hidden from IMG's website, making it difficult to manage and process our claims.</p>
            
            <h3>Lack of Regulatory Support</h3>
            <p>Complaints to the Indiana Department of Insurance went unanswered.</p>
            
            <h3>Financial Impact</h3>
            <p>We now face daily calls from collections and hospitals, causing significant stress and potentially impacting our credit.</p>
